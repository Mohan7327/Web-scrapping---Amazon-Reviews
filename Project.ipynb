Camera is excellent, Android 11 is very smooth to use, functions are fast.Just my first day of usage so hard to be critical of anything. The downside for me is that there is no place expand the memory.---Updating my review after 100 days of using. Bought on April 19th updated review on July 29th.Super fast charging.. 30 mins and goes from say 30% battery to 100% battery charge.I also bought the OnePlus Buds Z along with the phone and these are great quality. Connecting the buds sometimes is an issue. Sometimes it will connect automatically and sometimes it will not detect.Overall I still love this phone though I think its a bit heavy and large screen for non-gamers.',\n",

Lake blue colour is simply awesome 💙Issues1. Facing very lite heating issue.2. Found a bug and informed OnePlus customer service which is if we turn on call recording on call it indicates opponent also that we are recording call. They told they will correct it in next update. Hope this will be cleared but not sure.I give 95/100 for this mobile.',\n",

The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM. I think IQOO bootloader is not unlocked so keep that in mind.\",\n",

              " \"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)\",\n",

The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision.\",\n",
              " 'Review after 7 days of extensive usage.\\xa0•\\xa0I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It\\'s too smooth to handle after using this you\\'ll find thise \"IOS\" devices are lagging cuz they aren\\'t having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros:\\xa0•\\xa0Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the \"Call of Duty\" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps.\\xa0•\\xa0Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won\\'t heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room.\\xa0•\\xa0Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you\\'ll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up.\\xa0•\\xa0Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I\\'ve seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android.\\xa0•\\xa0User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can\\'t get rid of it\\'s addiction even you\\'ll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it\\'s the best UI I\\'ve ever used\\xa0•\\xa0You\\'ll get 5g support so you don\\'t need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth.\\xa0•\\xa0Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it\\'s completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it\\'s a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold.\\xa0•\\xa0Haptic is best in the price range.\\xa0•\\xa0Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place\\xa0•\\xa0Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You\\'ll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery.\\xa0•\\xa0Oneplus\\'s Fluid Amoled display is best screen I\\'ve ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons:\\xa0•\\xa0There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn\\'t justified for this kind of flagship devices. I\\'m mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly.\\xa0•\\xa0While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don\\'t know it\\'s a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I\\'ve discovered uptil now.\\xa0•\\xa0Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays.\\xa0•\\xa0Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it\\'s quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅.\\xa0•\\xa0Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like...\\xa0•\\xa01) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode.\\xa0•\\xa0Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker.\\xa0•\\xa0Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I\\'ve attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion:\\xa0•\\xa0If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it\\'s is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review.',\n",
              " 'You may get phones with better on paper specs at this price, but none have this quality. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. The frame is aluminium with a glass black and premium looking matte finish. Oxygen OS feels simple, practically useful and premium unlike those overwhelmingly bloated skins in Xiaomi, Vivo and Samsung phones. The phone has a great display, much better than the competition. The vibration motors are Iphone quality, not the usual cheap quality vibration motors found in the competitiors. The battery life is much better than advertised. I am able to get 6 hours of playtime on heavy games like COD Mobile on full charge. 65W fast charging is stupendously fast. No heating issues whatsoever even while gaming. Buttery smooth performance in daily usage as well as games. Idle battery time is amazing. The cameras are great but lack in colour calibration. Other competitors offer better cameras. Overall, Oneplus is the only brand offering clean software experience in this range, which is the most important thing in a phone.',\n",

              " \"It has been more than 3 months since i am using OP 9r. I have ordered it in first sale.So i must say everything is fabulous in this phone whether it is looks, performance, display Or Camera. Don't get confused when i say camera is great because many of the big youtubers have criticised its camera when compared it with Samasung galaxy s20 5G.So after seeing comparison i thought to switch to samsung galaxy s20 5G. So i decided to go to samsung store just to check if it is that good. And trust me guys, S20 looks way cheaper and like a normal phone. The time i took it in my hand i decided to stay with OP 9R. Even i have compared the camera as well and have not noticed any difference. So for normal users, if you are not a tech enthusiast, you won't be able to find any difference between two when it comes to camera. And please don't trust these youtubers. They are just making money by making us fool. Before making any decision just visit to the samsung or oneplus store.And as of now, i have not noticed any con in this phone. Everything is smooth specially the display. Also there is no heating issue but gets little warm during the charging. Battery life is also decent. If you are a normal user it will last one and half day. Also, it takes 40 to 45mins to charge it fully. So if you have the budget, then go for it. You will not regret it.\",\n",

Think so it get drained too fast... 🤔 But phone is good 😄Update after using 5 days :-Battery is great ( i usually recharge at night for 40 min and use nxt day )that means i charge only once in a day . it is enough if you dont play too much gamesi dont know y people are complaining reagrding heating issue..? 🤔 i found no heating issue from day 1 .Reduce the refrsh rate to 60 hz so your battery dont drain fast.

I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price.

Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Snapdragon 870. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend 9R because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras.

Also this can't be fixed with OTA updates due to limited hardware(affirmed by OnePlus in an official statement).Processor is the same 865 rebranded with very slight clockspeed increase on a single core.Battery is good,really good.65W charge is one of the best in it's league. A top competitor in battery.Good build quality.Decent speakers(Dolby stereo).Decent haptics.If the cons don't bother you and you just need a premium phone for basic use,then go for it(though this argument doesn't make sense since it's waste of money and you can buy a good mid range phone instead).Additional info-Want a gaming phone in the budget in neighborhood of 9R? Buy iQOO 7 Legend instead. A really balanced phone except the FunTouch OS which I ain't fan of. Also don't go for OnePlus 9 as it's useless device(especially the Indian variant).

The only workaround is to sideload the OnePlus dialer but then it has to be manually updated if and when there's a new update.I was in 2 minds after reading a lot of negative reviews here as well as on YouTube (particularly about the camera), but I am completely satisfied with the phone overall (including the camera).1.

For working professionals, after iphone and other true flagships in android (50k+ range), people recognise you the most with a oneplus device. The appeal on this one, specially blue color is really classy with minimalist branding- This is a pretty well balanced device overall. The processor is really smooth as it is a flagship processor. If you really want sd888, trust me go for oneplus 9 pro (if you can deal with average camera performance) or just wait for more device releases- the haptics are really solid. Before buying this phone online, i went to offline showrooms to get a inhand feel of all 35-40k phones, including samsung s20 fe 5g, oneplus 9R, mi 11x pro, iqoo 7. I really like the haptics of this phone.- The camera lacks some clarity but you really can shine your pics using snapseed. Even when you have an iphone, you still end up using a photo editor to make some corrections if you're really into taking good photos, so in terms of posting pics for online content you can get really good results.- Gcam mod is available for this phone, picture quality is better with the same- The punch hole is really non intrusive, you do not get bothered by it even when playing games or watching movies.- Audio output is really good. Dual speakers give you the surround experience- In hand feel is really solid and well built- The screen is really gorgeous, it is smooooth and produces vibrant colors.Under 40k, go for this one if you are looking for a balanced phone. Otherwise increase your budget and go with Samsung s20 fe 5g.\",\n",

Oxygen os made the overall usage excellent, highly optimised with a great balance of customisation. As someone who enjoys music and occasional games, I found this device to be amazing. Gets slightly warm when playing cod on maxed out graphics, but very manageable. It's not noticeable with the case provided in the box.

I was slightly disappointed with the camera, but after using an Asus zenfone max pro m1 since it's launch, I can say this still is not bad at all in ideal conditions. Music output through wired earphones is amazing with Dolby Atmos, just the way I imagined a flagship to be. Earlier reviews mentioned average battery life.

Coming to 5G, this device only supports one band- when the name prouldy includes this tag.Sorry for the long review, but this would be a 10/10 device if not for the slightly average camera and the lack of multiple 5G band support.

However it charges quickly in airplane mode and in power off mode.3) Camera is not up to the mark compared to 9 and 9 pro since it misses hasselblad but it's not too bad.4) Notification in the headphone mode setting is not working actually..even when we restrict the ringtone in the headset it rings.May be this can be fixed in next software updates.5) It supports only one 5g band whereas 9 and 9 pro supports two band.But the band n78 is supported in most of the countries.If camera is not much important for you then you can blindly choose this mobile. 😃\",\n",

Games drain the battery faster than expected. However the 65w warp chager charges the phone very fast and hence this nullifies the disadvantage of battery life. So not too worry about the battery.-Call quality is excellent-Camera is average for this price- fingerprint reader is best- sound quality is very good. The dual speakers is very good experience for watching movies . Dolby Atmos is an added advantage while using headphones- Performance is ultimate feature of this phoneOverall this is a good phone.
